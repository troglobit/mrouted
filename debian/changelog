mrouted (4.2) stable; urgency=medium

  * Support for controlling IGMP Last Member Query Count using the
    igmp-robustness setting in mrouted.conf, default 2
  * Support for tuning the IGMP Last Member Query Interval using a
    new setting igmp-query-last-member-interval <1-1024>
  * IGMPv3 membership reports were parsed incorrectly.  The problem affects
    users that use source specific multicast join, i.e., (S,G) join/leave
    using IGMPv3.  Support for IGMPv3 was introduced in mrouted v4.0
  * Issue #46: Malformed group-specific IGMP query.  The IGMP header no
    longer had the group field set, despite the query being addressed to a
    specific group.  Regression introduced in v4.0
  * Improved support for running mroutectl under watch(1).  No more
    artifacts due to unknown ANSI escape sequences to probe width
