mrouted (4.5) stable; urgency=low

  * Issue #54: support for explicit group memberships, using a new
    phyint keyword 'join-group <GROUP>'.  Forces an IGMPv2 join
    on the given interface.  Never expires

 -- Joachim Wiberg <troglobit@gmail.com>  (add date)

mrouted (4.4) stable; urgency=low

  * Issue #52: fix IPIP tunnels, both configuration and an off-by-one
    problem in unicast route distribution.
  * Fix 10 year old regression causing off-by-one (loss of one) in unicast
    route distribution (built-in RIP)  -- root cause for issue #52
  * Warn if installing tunnel vifs fail, probably missing ipip.ko
  * Logging to stdout now always prefix messages with daemon identity
  * Renamed tunnel vifs to match kernel names -> dvmrpN
  * Dropped RSRR feature (never enabled in Debian packages)

mrouted (4.3) stable; urgency=low
  * Add support for -i,--ident=NAME` to change identity of an instance
  * Add support for -p,--pidfile=FILE to override default PID file
  * Touch PID file at SIGHUP to acknowledge done reloading .conf file
  * Add support for -t,--table-id=ID, multicast routing tables
  * Add support for -u,--ipc=FILE to override /var/run/mrouted.sock file
  * Fix segfault when parsing phyint lines in .conf file interface
    cannot be found, e.g., phyint eth1 static-group 225.1.2.5
  * Prevent cascading warnings when phyint interface names cannot be found

mrouted (4.2) stable; urgency=medium

  * Support for controlling IGMP Last Member Query Count using the
    igmp-robustness setting in mrouted.conf, default 2
  * Support for tuning the IGMP Last Member Query Interval using a
    new setting igmp-query-last-member-interval <1-1024>
  * Support for static multicast routing, similar to SMCRoute, using a new
    phyint keyword 'static-group GROUP'.  Works as if an IGMPv2 join was
    received on the given interface.  Never expires
  * IGMPv3 membership reports were parsed incorrectly.  The problem affects
    users that use source specific multicast join, i.e., (S,G) join/leave
    using IGMPv3.  Support for IGMPv3 was introduced in mrouted v4.0
  * Proper tracking of lower-version IGMP hosts.  When a lower-version host
    joins a group no higer-version IGMP is allowed, e.g., IGMPv2 LEAVE is
    ignored if a group is in IGMPv1 compat mode
  * Allow IGMP reports from source address 0.0.0.0, for compliance with
    RFC3376.  Should improve interop with IGMP snooping switches and any
    DHCP client that has not yet received a lease
  * Issue #46: Malformed group-specific IGMP query.  The IGMP header no
    longer had the group field set, despite the query being addressed to a
    specific group.  Regression introduced in v4.0
  * Issue #47: parser did not allow the (optional) phyint keyword 'igmpv3'
  * Improved support for running mroutectl under watch(1).  No more
    artifacts due to unknown ANSI escape sequences to probe width
  * Delayed PID file creation until after initial startup delay, there
    is nobody home until after that delay, so no point in announcing
    availability until after that
  * Fix buffer overrun in descriptor `poll()` handling
  * Fix double-close on SIGHUP, Linux systems only
  * Various non-critical memory leak fixes, critical for no-MMU systems
