* Release 3.9.7: December 28, 2014
** Changes & New Features
   - SNMP Support removed.  It never compiled and would have likely
     needed a complete refactor to support modern AgentX.
   - Replaced static =config.mk= with configure script from pimd
   - RSRR Support disabled by default, use =--enable-rsrr= to configure script
   - Add ='enable'= to =phyint= directive and =-M/-N= command line options,
     thanks to Joseph Gooch (@goochjj)
   - Add David Waitzman and Craig Partridge to list of original authors
     after being contacted by Mr Waitzman :)
   - Change to use =stdint.h= types instead of type unsafe homegrown types

** Bug Fixes
   - Fix issue with older BSD kernels, mainly for current FreeBSD 10 and
     older, that don't really give RAW sockets but byte swap =ip_len=
     field, Olivier Cochard-Labbé (@ocochard)
   - Build fixes for FreeBSD, should make maintaining ports easier :)
   - Change from =select()= to =poll()= due to descriptor limits, e.g.,
     on BSD.
   - UNIX 2038 first audit, inspired by OpenBSD.  Cleanup type confusion
     int/u_long where it should be time_t.  Also, clarify that genid is
     OK, since it's used and stored as unsigned 32-bit integer.
   - Lots of minor fixes detected by Coverity Scan and Clang scan-build
     https://scan.coverity.com/projects/3320

* Release 3.9.6: October 23, 2011
** Changes & New Features
   - The Makefile now accepts CFLAGS from the environment instead of simply
     overriding. The old USERFLAGS variable, previously intended for this
     purpose, is still supported for backwards compatibility reasons.

** Bug Fixes

   - Serious regression in route.c, introduced in 3.9.5, caused by the link
     list refactor. Fix by Seth Hinze <ultrix@gmail.com>

   - Fix GCC 4.6 warnings for unused variables.

* Release 3.9.5: March 5, 2011
** Changes & New Features
  - The location of dump files have been moved from /var/tmp to /var/run/mrouted
    due to the insecure nature of /var/tmp.  See more below.

  - Add -r,--show-routes which sends SIGUSR1 to a running daemon, waits for the
    file /var/run/mrouted/mrouted.dump to be updated, and then displays the
    result on stdout.

** Bug Fixes
  - The linked list implementation used in route.c caused several problems and
    as a result has been refactored.  This fixes several SIGSEGV crashes a couple
    of memory leaks as well as GitHub issue #7.

  - Ported from pimd after CVE-2011-0007: Insecure file creation in /var/tmp.
    "On USR1, pimd will write to /var/tmp/pimd.dump a dump of the multicast route
    table. Since /var/tmp is writable by any user, a user can create a symlink to any
    file he wants to destroy with the content of the multicast routing table."

* Release 3.9.4: November 19, 2010

** Bug Fixes
  - ~kern.c:k_del_vif()~ does not work properly in Linux.

    When some interface (known by mrouted) goes down, mrouted tries to remove
    related VIF by calling ~stop_vif()~, which in turn calls ~k_del_vif()~.  After
    ~k_del_vif()~ is called, mrouted exits with the following error:

    setsockopt ~MRT_DEL_VIF~ on vif 3: Invalid argument

    The reason for this is due to differences in the Linux and *BSD ~MRT_DEL_VIF~
    API.  The Linux kernel expects to receive a ~struct vifctl~ associated with the
    VIF to be deleted, *BSD systems on the other hand expect to receive the index
    of that VIF.

* Release 3.9.3: October 11, 2010

** Changes & New Features
  - Update man page with =--long-options=, missing sections and improve debug help.

  - Cleanup Makefile for use with BSD PMake as well as GNU Make.

** Bug Fixes

  - Fix =NULL= pointer dereference in conf file parser.  Problem will arise for all
    interfaces that at one point might not have an address.

    Reported by Dan Kruchinin <mailto:dkruchinin@acm.org>

  - Fix problem with running the tunnel directive on OpenVPN, PPTP, L2TP tunnels as
    well as PPP links.  All of which use a 255.255.255.255 netmask on their interfaces.

    See http://openvpn.net/archive/openvpn-users/2004-04/msg00003.html for original
    problem report.

    Fix contributed by Dan Kruchinin <mailto:dkruchinin@acm.org>

  - ~route.c:accept_probe()~: Fix missing check of ~malloc()~ return value.

  - ~vif.c:SetTimer()~: Dito.

  - ~route.c:accept_report()~: Fix potential stack overflow issue.  Also added checks
    to prevent overstepping array boundaries in local ~rt[]~ array when parsing route
    report messages.

* Release 3.9.2: August 16, 2010

** Changes & New Features

  - Reduce code duplication on platforms carrying ~strlcpy()~ and ~strtonum()~.

** Bug Fixes
  - Fix file paths for GNU/Linux installations, they too use ~/var/tmp~ rather than
    ~/usr/tmp~ today.

  - Code fixes in RSRR code (disabled by default).

  - Fix possible build error in strtonum.c on platforms not supporting ~LLONG_MIN/MAX~

* Release 3.9.1: April 10, 2010

Biggest news in this release is that all OpenBSD patches as of this date are merged.

** Changes & New Featues

  - Change license to 3-clause BSD on mrinfo, RSRR and mrouted sources, thanks to
    hard working OpenBSD team!

  - Support for older yacc versions.

** Bug Fixes

  - OpenBSD, all patches from their CVS repository have been merged.  Things like
    missing free for malloc, missing checks for malloc return value, restart syscalls
    after signal (=EINTR=).  As well as a heap of neat code cleanup and modernization.

* Release 3.9.0: January 23, 2010

** Changes & New Features

  - Debian, build fixes for GNU/Linux.

  - FreeBSD ports collection, major API cleanups.

  - Buildroot, some minor cleanups of old deprecated APIs

  - Philippe Troin <mailto:phil@fifi.org>, added more compiler warnings and fixed the
    problems uncovered by that.

* 3.9-beta3: April 26, 1999

** Changes & New Features

  - A ~blaster~ keyword for mrouted.conf, to turn on handling of routers (mostly
    ciscos) which overwhelm the socket buffers by blasting the whole routing table at
    once.

  - A ~notransit~ keyword; routes learned on a ~notransit~ vif will not be
    readvertised onto another ~notransit~ vif.

  - The 500 kbps default rate limit on tunnels has been removed.

  - An ICMP listener which logs ICMP errors which appear to be in response to
    tunnel packets that we sent.

  - A tunnel traffic encapsulator, which encapsulates control traffic inside the
    tunnel instead of unicasting it ~beside~ the tunnel.  This is turned off by
    default; use ~beside off~ to turn it on.

  - A ~force_leaf~ flag to ignore any potential neighbors on a given interface.

** Bug Fixes

  - There was a bug handling routing updates which caused random black holes.

  - There was a race condition in the timer handlers causing free'd memory
    to sometimes get touched.

  - ~allow_nonpruners~ wasn't allowed in the configuration file (and almost
    nobody noticed! - probably a good sign)

  - When a prune times out and the source has been active "recently", mrouted now
    waits for further traffic instead of triggering a new prune.

  - mrouted now ignores unreachable routes when making a routing decision
    (previously it would blackhole, now it can find a less-specific)

* 3.9-beta2: June 11, 1997

There is no need to upgrade to 3.9-beta2 if you are not experiencing one of the
following bugs.

** Bug Fixes

  - There was a bug in 3.9-beta1's raw socket buffer processing that
    would cause an immediate lockup on startup on some systems.

  - RSRR would not clear out the group membership information if
    further notification of changes to this route entry was not possible.

* 3.9-beta1: June 6, 1997

** Changes & New Features

  - Longer prune lifetimes (2 hours) by default.  Prune lifetimes may be configured
    per-vif, with the ~prune_lifetime N~ mrouted.conf configuration file entry
    (where N is in seconds).  This helps to work around the black holes caused on
    restart when you have a Cisco upstream which does not handle genid's; if this is
    your situation the recommended value is 300.

  - mrouted's behavior of flooding new routes by default at startup in order to speed
    healing of paths during startup can be turned off per-vif or globally with the
    ~noflood~ configuration option.  Turning this option off means you are likely to
    experience black holes for a minute or two when you restart a router.  The
    default is to flood for a minute or two until mrouted is able to learn
    subordinate relationships.

  - mrouted now retransmits prunes by default on point-to-point links.  The
    mrouted.conf command ~rexmit_prunes [on|off]~ can be used to enable or disable
    this feature on a per-vif basis.  Prune retransmission helps on lossy links, and
    also helps when a router has forgotten about a prune (e.g. if it is out of memory
    and needs to shed state, or due to a bug).

  - The new ~passive~ mode causes mrouted to not actively send probes looking for
    neighbors.  This allows a dialup link to become quiescent if there is no DVMRP
    neighbor on the other end.  Configuring ~passive~ on both ends of a link will
    cause it to never come up.

  - mrouted defaults to not peering with DVMRP routers that do not prune.  Use the
    ~allow_nonpruners~ mrouted.conf option on a vif on which you want to allow such
    peerings.

  - mrouted now allows route filtering using ~allow~ and ~deny~ in ~mrouted.conf~.
    - Only ~accept~ or ~deny~ is allowed, no combinations.

    - Add ~bidir~ to apply the filter to output too, otherwise it's input only.

    - Expected usage:
      - Providers filter routes that customers send them
      - Martian removal
      - Topology modification (e.g. don't let the existence of private tunnel foo out
        into the world).

    - Syntax:
        - accept 13/8 :: All routes matching 13/8 (e.g. 13.2.116/22)
        - accept 13/8 exact :: If you want to accept exactly 13/8
        - deny 10/8 64/2 130/8 exact 172/8 exact :: Common MBone martians

  - mrouted now malloc's the buffer it uses for ~SIOCGIFCONF~, to allow
    for more interfaces.  Thanks to Danny Mitzel

  - mrouted now ignores multiple entries for a single interface name (temporary hack
    until mrouted understands interface aliases)

  - mrouted's ~-d~ flag has been modified to accept the names of the systems which
    you would like to debug:  packet, prunes, routes, peers, cache, timeout,
    interface, membership, traceroute, igmp

  - mrouted now times neighbors out fater, and fully detects and ignores routes from
    one-way peerings.

  - mrouted's route processing has been sped up, especially at startup.

  - mrouted uses the biggest ~SO_RCVBUF~ the operating system allows (up to 256 kb)

  - mrouted uses TOS =0xC0= ("Internet Control") for DVMRP messages.

** Known Bugs

  - The startup message doesn't print properly if you have too many interfaces.

** Bug Fixes

  - mrouted did not properly keep track of subordinates, and would not time out
    subordinateness.  This caused 2 major problems:

    1. pruning did not happen when there were equal-cost paths to the same
       multi-access link
    2. subordinateness which did not get cancelled by a non-poisoned route (e.g. in
       the face of route filtering) did not time out, causing traffic to continue to
       flow.

  - mrouted's IGMPv2 processing when it is not the querier now conforms to
    draft-ietf-idmr-igmp-v2-06.txt Thanks to Lorenzo VICISANO
    <mailto:L.Vicisano@cs.ucl.ac.uk> for finding a problem.

  - mrouted is much more careful about forgetting prunes; 3.8 would forget prunes
    whenever any route change ocurred.

* Release 3.8: November 29, 1995

** Bug Fixes

  - mrouted would fail to forget prunes when a neighbor went away, thus potentially
    sending traffic down a tunnel after the tunnel endpoint has gone down.  This was
    due to some research code making it into the "emergency" 3.7 release, sigh.

  - mrouted could send prunes with negative lifetimes.  This causes slightly higher
    prune traffic but shouldn't be any major problem.

* Release 3.7: November 28, 1995

** Changes & New Features

  - The configuration file can accept a hostname as the other end of a tunnel.  There
    must be a single name=>ip mapping for the given name, however, or mrouted will
    fail to start up.

  - mrinfo now sends requests to all interfaces of a multihomed host.

  - mtrace's passive mode has been implemented.

  - The first screen of mtrace statistics is shorter and more likely
    to fit on one screen.

** Bug Fixes

  - mrouted now ignores route reports that include bogus netmasks.
    There was a bug in 3.5 that would mangle default routes into
    tens of bogus routes; this should prevent that bug from killing
    the MBONE.

    This solution can cause route flaps and black holes until the
    3.5's are gone or all of the 3.5's neighbors are 3.7 .

  - mrouted now ignores duplicate routes.  Ciscos and the above 3.5
    bug could cause two copies of the same route to appear in a single
    routing update; mrouted would insert two copies of the same route
    into its routing table and wreak all sorts of havoc.

  - mrouted now sends a group-specific query for both retransmissions
    of a g-s query; previous versions sent a general query the second
    time.

  - mrouted now loops back multicasted mtrace responses and
    group-specific membership queries

  - mrouted now performs deterministic tiebreaking between two
    neighbors on the same vif.

  - mrouted now only does duplicate suppression on traceroute requests,
    not all traceroute packets, so that a loop can be nicely detected
    via a duplicate router instead of just a timeout.

  - the buffer size that mrouted uses has been increased to allow
    more than 16 hops in mtrace messages.

  - mtrace's hop-by-hop termination is now more likely to be correct.

  - mrinfo now waits for the responses to its retransmitted queries.

* Release 3.6: June 26, 1995

** Bug Fixes

  - mrouted would dump core when attempting to report no routes (i.e. upon
    startup, if you have no enabled phyint's)

  - mrouted would dump core if requested to traceroute a source for which it
    had no route

  - neighbor flags were not always properly updated on probe or report

  - mrouted would sometimes reply to a multicast traceroute on a disabled
    phyint; now it uses the first configured phyint to reply to traceroutes.

  - host routes (i.e. netmask =0xffffffff=) works now; it was discarding
    IGMP from the host because it was coming from the "broadcast address"
    of the subnet.

  - ~send_igmp()~ now treats the failure to send an mtrace or a neighbor
    reply as informational, as opposed to warning.

  - mrouted would go into an infinite loop trying to respond to a traceroute
    for a source with a netmask of =0xffffffff=.

  - ~vifs_with_neighbors~ was not being reset if the mrouted was restarted
    with =SIGHUP=.

  - the default route was not being properly advertised to neighbors (although
    it was accepted if it was advertised to it)

  - ANSI-fication for those who it helps, still-K&R-ish for those it doesn't.

  - mtrace now attempts to trace three hops past a non-responding router,
    in the hopes that it does support traceroute but just couldn't respond
    (i.e. unicast didn't work and it can't source multicast because all its
    phyints are disabled).

  - mrinfo now times out even on a multicast router.

* Release 3.5: May 8, 1995

** Changes & New Features

  - The kernel and mrouted make sure that each is the correct version, to
    prevent problems with mismatched kernel/mrouted versions.  A too-old
    mrouted will die with the error:

    can't enable DVMRP routing in kernel: Option not supported by protocol

  - mrouted can accept and propogate a default route (essential for
    heirarchical multicast routing)

  - Kernel route cache keeps source-specific routes instead of subnet routes,
    eliminating hashing and longest-match problems.
    (allows classless routing, longest-match and default routing)

  - Cached kernel routes only get deleted if no traffic is flowing, to
    facilitate multicast traceroute

  - mrouted has a new configuration file parser, which provides better error
    messages than before, and allows named boundaries (see man page)

  - added ~netmask~ to phyint configuration, at the suggestion of
    Anders Klemets

  - System V and FreeBSD compatibility from John Brezak <mailto:brezak@ch.hp.com>

  - phyint's can have additional subnets configured, for people with multiple
    subnets on one physical network.  mrouted.conf syntax is altnet 1.2.3.0,
    or altnet 1.2.3.0/24 if you need to specify a different netmask.  There
    can be as many altnet statements as you need.

  - both mrouted and the kernel now support classless addresses.

  - the kernel supports PIM assert processing by notifying the router
    when a packet arrives on the wrong interface

  - the kernel keeps additional counters, and mrouted can be compiled to
    support SNMP and the Multicast MIB

  - the packet classifier in the kernel now uses the following udp port
    ranges.  A future release of a session directory will allocate ports in
    these ranges:

    - ~[0, 16384)~: lowest priority, unclassified

    - ~[16384, 32768)~: highest priority, i.e. audio

    - ~[32768, 49152)~: medium priority, i.e. whiteboard

    - ~[49152, 65536)~: low priority, i.e. video

  - the configuration code has been modified to default tunnels' ~rate_limit~
    parameters to 500kbps.  This is easily modified with a ~rate_limit~ keyword
    in mrouted.conf, but should be a good default for the MBONE in general.

  - The tunnel sending code now caches a route for ~ip_output()~, this should
    help performance on machines with lots of tunnels.

  - Dispatching for de-capsulating packets is now via protosw[], making
    reception of other raw protocols more efficient

  - Neighbor capabilities are discovered via a bitmask as opposed to
    version number.

  - Multicast traceroute code improved

  - mrouted can be compiled with Routing Support for Resource Reservation
    (RSRR), required for RSVP.

** Bug Fixes

  - The IGMPv2 query timeout field was interpreted as being in units of 200ms
    as opposed to 100ms, thus the maximum timeout was set to twice the
    expected value.  This is not fatal, as mrouted always queries twice in the
    expectation that a packet could get loss, but it does make it less robust
    in the face of packet loss.

  - IGMP could report membership in local-only groups (i.e. 224.0.0.X)

  - IGMP could get confused by hearing its own new membership reports, thus
    a router would never perform fast leave.

  - IGMP could reset timers for the wrong interface.

  - mrouted put a bogus value in the maximum timeout field of IGMPv2 query
    packets.

  - Non-querier mrouters would respond to IGMP leave messages

  - mrouted was not performing fast leave properly

  - If the last member goes away on a transit network, the upstream router
    would stop forwarding even if there are downstream members.

  - Kernel hash function improved

  - Eliminated possibility of ~panic()~: timeout in cache maintenance

  - Reordered resource allocation when sending upcall to handle failure properly

  - some endian-ness bugs squashed in mrouted, probably more to go.

  - Multicast traceroute could send a reply on a disabled interface.
